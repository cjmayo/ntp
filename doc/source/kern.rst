Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping
======================================

The technical report [2], which is a revision and update of an earlier
report [3], describes an engineering model for a precision clock
discipline function for a generic operating system. The model is the
same hybrid phase/frequecy-lock feedback loop used by ``ntpd``, but
implemented in the kernel. The code described in [2] is included in
Solaris and Digital/Compaq/HP Tru64. It provides two system calls
``ntp_gettime()`` and ``ntp_adjtime()`` and can discipline the system
clock with microsecond resolution. However, newer hardware and kernels
with the same system calls can discipline the clock with nanosecond
resolution. The new code described in [1] is in FreeBSD, Linux and
Tru64. The software and documentation, including a simulator used to
verify correct behavior, but not involving licensed code, is available
in the
`nanokernel.tar.gz <ftp://ftp.udel.edu/pub/ntp/software/nanokernel.tar.gz>`__
distribution

Ordinarily, the kernel clock discipline function is used with the NTP
daemon, but could be used for other purposes. The
:doc:`ntptime
<ntptime>` utility program can be used to
control it manually.

The kernel model also provides support for an external precision timing
source, such as described in the
:doc:`Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal Interfacing
<pps>` page. The new system calls are used by
the :doc:`PPSAPI interface
<kernpps>` and in turn by the
:doc:`PPS Clock Discipline
<drivers/driver22>` driver (type 22) to provide
synchronization limited in principle only by the accuracy and stability
of the external timing source. Typical results with the PPS signal from
a GPS receiver and a modern computer are in the 3 μs range.
