NTP Version 4 Release Notes
===========================

NTP has been under development for almost 30 years, but the paint ain't
dry even now. This release of the NTP Version 4 (NTPv4) distribution for
Unix, VMS and Windows incorporates new features and refinements, but
retaining backwards compatibility with older versions, including NTPv3
and NTPv2, but not NTPv1. Support for NTPv1 has been discontinued
because of certain security vulnerabilities.

New Features
---------------------------------------

-  The behavior of the daemon at startup has been considerably improved.
   The time to measure the frequency and correct an initial offset error
   when started for the first time is now no more than ten minutes. Upon
   restart, it takes no more than five minutes to reduce the initial
   offset to less than one millisecond without adversely affecting the
   frequency. This avoids a subsequent frequency correction which could
   take up to several hours.
-  A new feature called interleaved mode can be used in NTP symmetric
   and broadcast modes. It is designed to improve accuracy by minimizing
   errors due to queuing and transmission delays. It is described on the
   :doc:`NTP Interleaved Modes
   <xleave>` page.
-  The huff-n'-puff filter is designed to avoid large errors with DSL
   circuits and highly asymmetrical traffic, as when downloading large
   files. Details are on the :doc:`The
   Huff-n'-Puff Filter <huffpuff>` page.
-  A new feature called orphan mode provides an automatic, subnet-wide
   synchronization feature with multiple sources. It provides reliable
   backup in isolated networks or in pr when Internet sources have
   become unavailable. See the :doc:`Orphan
   Mode <orphan>` page for further information.
-  This release includes comprehensive packet rate management tools to
   help reduce the level of spurious network traffic and protect the
   busiest servers from overload. There is support for the optional
   Kiss-o'-Death (KoD) packet intended to slow down an abusive client.
   See the :doc:`Rate Management and the
   Kiss-o'-Death Packet <rate>` page for
   further information.
-  There are two new burst mode features available where special
   conditions apply. One of these is enabled by the ``iburst`` keyword
   in the ``server`` configuration command. It is intended for cases
   where it is important to set the clock quickly when an association is
   first mobilized. The other is enabled by the ``burst`` keyword in the
   ``server`` configuration command. It is intended for cases where the
   network attachment requires an initial calling or training procedure.
   See the :doc:`Association Management
   <assoc>` page for further information.
-  The OpenSSL cryptographic library has replaced the library formerly
   available from RSA Laboratories. All cryptographic routines except a
   version of the MD5 message digest algorithm have been removed from
   the base distribution. All 128-bit and 160-bit message digests
   algorithms are now supported for both symmetric key and public key
   cryptosystems. See the :doc:`Authentication
   Support <authentic>` page for further
   information and the :doc:`Authentication
   Options <authopt>` page for a list of
   supported digest algorithms.
-  This release includes support for Autokey public-key cryptography for
   authenticating public servers to clients, as described in RFC 5906.
   This support requires the --enable-autokey option when building the
   distribution, which is the default is OpenSSL is available. The
   deployment of Autokey subnets is now considerably simpler than in
   earlier versions. A subnet naming scheme is now available to filter
   manycast and pool configurations. Additional information about
   Autokey is on the :doc:`Autokey Public Key
   Authentication <autokey>` page and links
   from there.
-  The NTP descrete even simulator has been substantially upgraded, now
   including scenarios with multiple servers and time-sensitive scripts.
   This allows the NTPÂ algorithms to be tested in an embedded
   environment with systematic and pseudo-random network delay and
   oscillator wander distributions. This has been used to verify correct
   operation under conditions of extreme error and misconfiguration. See
   the :doc:`ntpdsim - Network Time Protocol
   (NTP) simulator <ntpdsim>` page. A technical
   description and performance analysis is given in the white papers at
   the `NTP Project Page <http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp.html>`__.
-  NTPv4 includes three new server discovery schemes, which in most
   applications can avoid per-host configuration altogether. Two of
   these are based on IP multicast technology, while the remaining one
   is based on crafted DNS lookups. See the
   :doc:`Automatic NTP Configuration Schemes
   <discover>` page for further information.
-  The status display and event report monitoring functions have been
   considerably expanded, including new statistics files and event
   reporting to files and the system log. See the
   :doc:`Event Messages and Status Words
   <decode>` page for further information.
-  Several new options have been added for the ``ntpd`` command line.
   For the inveterate knob twiddlers several of the more important
   performance variables can be changed to fit actual or perceived
   special conditions. In particular, the ``tinker`` and ``tos``
   commands can be used to adjust thresholds, throw switches and change
   limits.
-  The ``ntpd`` daemon can be operated in a one-time mode similar to
   ``ntpdate``, which program is headed for retirement. See the
   :doc:`ntpd - Network Time Protocol (NTP)
   daemon <ntpd>` page for the new features.
-  A number of white papers have been added to the library on the NTP
   Research Project Page, including:

Changes and Upgrades Since the NTPv3 Version (xntp3-5)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes general changes since the publication of
RFC-1305. Specific changes made during the code upgrade of 2007-2008 are
summarized in :doc:`Historical Notes
<history>`.

-  If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 (RFC-2553) is
   detected, support for the IPv6 address family is supported in
   addition to the default support for the IPv4 address family. In
   contexts where a host name is expected, a ``-4`` qualifier preceding
   the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a
   ``-6`` qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.
-  Many changes have been made in the NTP algorithms to improve
   performance and reliability A clock state machine has been
   incorporated to improve behavior under transient conditions. The
   clock discipline algorithm has been redesigned to improve accuracy,
   reduce the impact of network disruptions and allow increased poll
   intervals to 36 hours with only moderate sacrifice in accuracy. The
   clock select, cluster and combine algorithms have been overhauled as
   the result of a thorough statistical analysis.
-  In all except a very few cases, all timing intervals are randomized,
   so that the tendency for NTPv3 to self-synchronize and bunch
   messages, especially with a large number of configured associations,
   is minimized.
-  Support for the precision time kernel modifications, which are now in
   stock FreeBSD and optional in Linux kernels, is included. With this
   support the system clock can be disciplined to the order of one
   nanosecond. The older microtime kernel modifications in
   Digital/Compaq/HP Tru64, Digital Ultrix and Sun Microsystems SunOS
   and Solaris, continue to be supported. In either case the support
   eliminates sawtooth error, which can be in the hundreds of
   microseconds. Further information is on the
   :doc:`Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping
   <kern>` page.
-  New reference clock drivers have been added for several GPS receivers
   now on the market for a total of 44 drivers. The reference clock
   driver interface is smaller, more rational, more flexible and more
   accurate. Most of the drivers in NTPv3 have been converted to the
   NTPv4 interface and continue to operate as before. A summary of the
   supported drivers is on the :doc:`Reference
   Clock Support <refclock>` page. Audio
   drivers for the Canadian standard time and frequency station CHU, the
   US standard time and frequency stations WWV/H and for IRIG signals
   have been updated and capabilities added to allow direct connection
   of these signals to an audio port. See the
   :doc:`Reference Clock Audio Drivers
   <audio>` page for further information.
-  Support for pulse-per-second (PPS) signals has been extended to all
   drivers as an intrinsic function. Further information is on the
   :doc:`Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) Signal
   Interfacing <pps>` page. Typical performance
   with the PPS interface and a fast machine are in the low
   microseconds.
-  Several small changes have been made to make administration and
   maintenance more convenience. The entire distribution has been
   converted to gnu ``automake``, which greatly ease the task of porting
   to new and different programming environments, as well as reduce the
   incidence of bugs due to improper handling of idiosyncratic kernel
   functions. Version control is provided by Bitkeeper using an online
   repository at www.ntp.org. Trouble ticket reporting is provided using
   Bugzilla. If ``ntpd``, is configured with NetInfo support, it will
   attempt to read its configuration from the NetInfo service if the
   default ``ntp.conf`` file cannot be read and no file is specified by
   the ``-c`` option. When ``ntpd`` starts it looks at the value of
   ``umask``, and if zero ``ntpd`` will set the ``umask`` to ``022``.

.. _release-nasty:

Nasty Surprises
--------------------------------------------

There are a few things different about this release that have changed
since the latest NTP Version 3 release. Following are a few things to
worry about:

-  Some configuration commands have been removed, others added and some
   changed in minor ways. See the :doc:`Command
   Index <comdex>`.
-  When both IPv4 and IPv6 address families are in use, the host's
   resolver library may not choose the intended address family if a
   server has an IPv4 and IPv6 address associated with the same DNS
   name. The solution is to use the IPv4 or IPv6 address directly in
   such cases or use another DNS name that resolves to the intended
   address family. Older versions of ``ntpdc`` will show only the IPv4
   associations with the ``peers`` and some other commands. Older
   versions of ``ntpq`` will show 0.0.0.0 for IPv6 associations with the
   ``peers`` and some other commands.
-  There is a minor change to the reference ID field of the NTP packet
   header when operating with IPv6 associations. In IPv4 associations
   this field contains the 32-bit IPv4 address of the server, in order
   to detect and avoid loops. In IPv6 associations this field contains
   the first 32-bits of a MD5 hash formed from the IPv6 address. All
   programs in the distribution have been modified to work with both
   address families.
-  The ``tty_clk`` and ``ppsclock`` pulse-per-second (PPS) line
   discipline/streams modules are no longer supported. The PPS function
   is now handled by the :doc:`PPS Clock
   Discipline <drivers/driver22>` driver, which
   uses the new PPSAPI application program interface adopted by the
   IETF. Note that the ``pps`` configuration file command has been
   obsoleted by the driver. See the
   :doc:`Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) Signal
   Interfacing <pps>` page for further
   information.
-  Support for the NTPv1 symmetric mode has been discontinued, since it
   hasn't worked for years. Support continues for the NTPv1 client mode,
   which is used by some SNTP clients.
-  The ``authstuff`` directory, intended as a development and testing
   aid for porting cryptographic routines to exotic architectures, has
   been removed. Testing and conformance validation tools are available
   in the OpenSSL software distribution.
