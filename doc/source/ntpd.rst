.. _ntpd-descr:

Description
----------------------------------------

The ``ntpd`` program is an operating system daemon that synchronizes the
system clock to remote NTP time servers or local reference clocks. It is
a complete implementation of NTP version 4 defined by :rfc:`5905`, but also
retains compatible with version 3 defined by :rfc:`1305` and versions 1 and
2, defined by :rfc:`1059` and :rfc:`1119`, respectively. The program can
operate in any of several modes, including client/server, symmetric and
broadcast modes, and with both symmetric-key and public key-cryptography

The ``ntpd`` program ordinarily requires a configuration file described
on this page. It contains configuration commands described on the pages
listed above. However a client can discover remote servers and configure
them automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of
workstations without specifying configuration details specific to the
local environment. Further details are on the

The ``ntpd`` program normally operates continuously while adjusting the
system time and frequency, but in some cases this might not be
practical. With the ``-q`` option ``ntpd`` operates as in continuous
mode, but exits just after setting the clock for the first time. Most
applications will probably want to specify the ``iburst`` option with
the ``server`` command. With this option a volley of messages is
exchanged to groom the data and set the clock in about ten seconds. If
nothing is heard after a few minutes, the daemon times out and exits
without setting the clock.

.. _ntpd-cmd:

Command Line Options
-----------------------------------------------

.. option:: -4

    Force DNS resolution of host names to the IPv4 namespace.

.. option:: -6

    Force DNS resolution of host names to the IPv6 namespace.

.. option:: -a

    Require cryptographic authentication for broadcast client, multicast
    client and symmetric passive associations. This is the same
    operation as the ``enable auth`` command and is the default.

.. option:: -A

    Do not require cryptographic authentication for broadcast client,
    multicast client and symmetric passive associations. This is the
    same operation as the ``disable auth`` command and almost never a
    good idea.

.. option:: -b

    Enable the client to synchronize to broadcast servers.

.. option:: -c <conffile>

    Specify the name and path of the configuration file. Without the
    option the default is ``/etc/ntp.conf``.

.. option:: -d

    Disable switching into daemon mode, so ``ntpd`` stays attached to
    the starting terminal which will get all the debugging printout.
    Also, ^C will kill it. This option may occur more than once, with
    each occurrence indicating greater detail of display.

.. option:: -D <level>

    Specify debugging level directly, with ``level`` corresponding to
    the numbe of ``-d`` options..

.. option:: -f <driftfile>

    Specify the name and path of the frequency file. This is the same
    operation as the ``driftfile driftfile`` configuration command.

.. option:: -g

    Normally, ``ntpd`` exits with a message to the system log if the
    offset exceeds the panic threshold, which is 1000 s by default. This
    option allows the time to be set to any value without restriction;
    however, this can happen only once. If the threshold is exceeded
    after that, ``ntpd`` will exit with a message to the system log.
    This option can be used with the ``-q`` and ``-x`` options. See the
    ``tinker`` command for other options.

.. option:: -i <jaildir>

    Chroot the server to the directory ``jaildir``. This option also
    implies that the server attempts to drop root privileges at startup
    (otherwise, chroot gives very little additional security), and it is
    only available if the OS supports to run the server without full
    root privileges. You may need to also specify a ``-u`` option.

.. _ntpd---interface:

.. option:: -I [address | interface name]

    Open the network address given, or all the addresses associated with
    the given interface name. This option may appear multiple times.
    This option also implies not opening other addresses, except
    wildcard and localhost. This option is deprecated. Please consider
    using the configuration file
    :ref:`interface <miscopt-interface>` command, which is more versatile.

.. option:: -k <keyfile>

    Specify the name and path of the symmetric key file. This is the
    same operation as the ``keys keyfile`` command.

.. option:: -l <logfile>

    Specify the name and path of the log file. The default is the system
    log file. This is the same operation as the ``logfile logfile``
    command.

.. _ntpd---mdns:

.. option:: -m

    Once the system clock is synchronized, register with mDNS as an
    available server.

.. _ntpd---novirtualips:

.. option:: -L

    Do not listen to virtual interfaces, defined as those with names
    containing a colon. This option is deprecated. Please consider using
    the configuration file
    :ref:`interface  <miscopt-interface>` command, which is more versatile.

.. option:: -M

    Raise scheduler precision to its maximum (1 ms) using
    timeBeginPeriod. (Windows only)

.. option:: -n

    Don't fork.

.. option:: -N

    To the extent permitted by the operating system, run the ``ntpd`` at
    the highest priority.

.. option:: -p <pidfile>

    Specify the name and path of the file used to record the ``ntpd``
    process ID. This is the same operation as the ``pidfile pidfile``
    command.

.. option:: -P <priority>

    To the extent permitted by the operating system, run the ``ntpd`` at
    the specified priority.

.. option:: -q

    Exit the ``ntpd`` just after the first time the clock is set. This
    behavior mimics that of the ``ntpdate`` program, which is to be
    retired. The ``-g`` and ``-x`` options can be used with this option.
    Note: The kernel time discipline is disabled with this option.

.. option:: -r <broadcastdelay>

    Specify the default propagation delay from the broadcast/multicast
    server to this client. This is necessary only if the delay cannot be
    computed automatically by the protocol.

.. option:: -s <statsdir>

    Specify the directory path for files created by the statistics
    facility. This is the same operation as the ``statsdir statsdir``
    command.

.. option:: -t <key>

    Add a key number to the trusted key list. This option can occur more
    than once. This is the same operation as the ``trustedkey key``
    command.

.. option:: -u user[:group]

    Specify a user, and optionally a group, to switch to. This option is
    only available if the OS supports running the server without full
    root privileges. Currently, this option is supported under NetBSD
    (configure with ``--enable-clockctl``) and Linux (configure with
    ``--enable-linuxcaps``).

.. option:: -U number, --updateinterval=number

    Number of seconds to wait between interface list scans to pick up
    old and delete network interface. Set to 0 to disable dynamic
    interface list updating. The default is to scan every 5 minutes.

.. option::
    -v <variable>
    -V <variable>

    Add a system variable listed by default.

.. option:: -x

    Normally, the time is slewed if the offset is less than the step
    threshold, which is 128 ms by default, and stepped if above the
    threshold. This option sets the threshold to 600 s, which is well
    within the accuracy window to set the clock manually. Note: Since
    the slew rate of typical Unix kernels is limited to 0.5 ms/s, each
    second of adjustment requires an amortization interval of 2000 s.
    Thus, an adjustment as much as 600 s will take almost 14 days to
    complete. This option can be used with the ``-g`` and ``-q``
    options. See the ``tinker`` command for other options. Note: The
    kernel time discipline is disabled with this option.

.. option:: --pccfreq <frequency>

    Substitute processor cycle counter for QueryPerformanceCounter
    unconditionally using the given frequency (in Hz). ``--pccfreq`` can
    be used on systems which do not use the PCC to implement
    QueryPerformanceCounter and have a fixed PCC frequency. The
    frequency specified must be accurate within 0.5 percent.
    ``--usepcc`` is equivalent on many systems and should be tried
    first, as it does not require determining the frequency of the
    processor cycle counter. For x86-compatible processors, the PCC is
    also referred to as ``RDTSC``, which is the assembly-language
    instruction to retrieve the current value.Â  (Windows only)

.. option:: --usepcc

    Substitute processor cycle counter for QueryPerformanceCounter if
    they appear equivalent. This option should be used only if the PCC
    frequency is fixed. Power-saving functionality on many laptops
    varies the PCC frequency. (Windows only)

.. _ntpd-cfg:

The Configuration File
-------------------------------------------------

Ordinarily, ``ntpd`` reads the ``ntp.conf`` configuration file at
startup in order to determine the synchronization sources and operating
modes. It is also possible to specify a working, although limited,
configuration entirely on the command line, obviating the need for a
configuration file. This may be particularly useful when the local host
is to be configured as a broadcast client, with servers determined by
listening to broadcasts at run time.

Usually, the configuration file is installed as ``/etc/ntp.conf``, but
could be installed elsewhere (see the ``-c conffile`` command line
option). The file format is similar to other Unix configuration files -
comments begin with a ``#`` character and extend to the end of the line;
blank lines are ignored.

Configuration commands consist of an initial command keyword followed by
a list of option keywords separated by whitespace. Commands may not be
continued over multiple lines. Options may be host names, host addresses
written in numeric, dotted-quad form, integers, floating point numbers
(when specifying times in seconds) and text strings. Optional arguments
are delimited by ``[ ]`` in the options pages, while alternatives are
separated by ``|``. The notation ``[ ... ]`` means an optional,
indefinite repetition of the last item before the ``[ ... ]``.
