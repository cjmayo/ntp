Mitigation Rules and the ``prefer`` Keyword
===========================================

This page summarizes the criteria for choosing from among the survivors
of the clock cluster algorithm a set of contributors to the clock
discipline algorithm. The criteria are very meticulous, since they have
to handle many different scenarios that may be optimized for special
circumstances, including some scenarios designed to support planetary
and deep space missions. For additional information on statistical
principles and performance metrics, see the
:doc:`Performance Metrics
<stats>` page.

Recall the suite of NTP data acquisition and grooming algorithms. These
algorithms proceed in five phases. Phase one discovers the available
*sources* and mobilizes an association for each source found. These
sources can result from explicit configuration, broadcast discovery or
the pool and manycast autonomous configuration schemes. See the
:doc:`Automatic Server Discovery Schemes
<discover>` page for further information.

Phase two selects the *candidates* from among the sources by excluding
those sources showing one or more of the errors summarized on the
:doc:`Clock Select Algorithm
<select>` page and to determine the
*truechimers* from among the candidates, leaving behind the
*falsetickers*. A server or peer configured with the ``true`` option is
declared a truechimer independent of this algorithm. Phase four uses the
algorithm described on the :doc:`Clock Cluster
Algorithm <cluster>` page to prune the
statistical outliers from the truechimers, leaving the *survivor list*
as result.

Phase five uses a set of algorithms and mitigation rules to combined the
survivor statistics and discipline the system clock. The mitigation
rules select from among the survivors a *system peer* from which a set
of system statistics can be inherited and passed along to dependent
clients, if any. The mitigation algorithms and rules are the main topic
of this page. The clock offset developed from these algorithms can
discipline the system clock, either using the
:doc:`clock discipline algorithm
<discipline>` or using the kernel to discipline
the system clock directly, as described on the
:doc:`A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping
<kern>` page.

.. _prefer-combine:

Combine Algorithm
------------------------------------------------

The clock combine algorithm uses the survivor list to produce a weighted
average of both offset and jitter. Absent other considerations discussed
later, the *combined offset* is used to discipline the system clock,
while the *combined jitter* is augmented with other components to
produce the system jitter statistic inherited by dependent clients, if
any.

The clock combine algorithm uses a weight factor for each survivor equal
to the reciprocal of the root distance. This is normalized so that the
sum of the reciprocals is equal to unity. This design favors the
survivors at the smallest root distance and thus the smallest maximum
error.

.. _prefer-clockhop:

Anti-Clockhop Algorithm
-------------------------------------------------------

The anti-clockhop algorithm is intended for cases where multiple servers
are available on a fast LAN with modern computers. Typical offset
differences between servers in such cases are less than 0.5 ms. However,
changes between servers can result in unnecessary system jitter. The
object of the anti-clockhop algorithm is to avoid changing the current
system peer, unless it becomes stale or has significant offset relative
to other candidates on the survivor list.

For the purposes of the following description, call the last selected
system peer the *old peer*, and the currently selected source the
*candidate peer*. At each update, the candidate peer is selected as the
first peer on the survivor list sorted by increasing root distance. The
algorithm initializes the -*clockhop threshold* with the value of
``mindist``, by default 1 ms.

The anti-clockhop algorithm is called immediately after the combine
algorithm. If there was no old peer or the old and candidate peers are
the same, the candidate peer becomes the system peer. If the old peer
and the candidate peer are different, the algorithm measures the
difference between the offset of the old peer and the candidate peer. If
the difference exceeds the clockhop threshold, the candidate peer
becomes the system peer and the clockhop threshold is restored to its
original value. If the difference is less than the clockhop threshold,
the old peer continues as the system peer. However, at each subsequent
update, the algorithm reduces the clockhop threshold by half. Should
operation continue in this way, the candidate peer will eventually
become the system peer.

.. _prefer-peer:

Peer Classification
-----------------------------------------------

The behavior of the various algorithms and mitigation rules involved
depends on how the various synchronization sources are classified. This
depends on whether the source is local or remote and if local, the type
of source. The following classes are defined:

#. A selectable association configured for a remote server or peer is
   classified as a *client association*. All other selectable
   associations are classified as *device driver associations* of one
   kind or another. In general, one or more sources of either type will
   be available in each installation.
#. If all sources have been lost and one or more hosts on a common DMZ
   network have specified the orphan stratum in the ``orphan`` option of
   the :ref:`tos
   <miscopt-tos>` command, each of them can
   become an *orphan parent*. Dependent orphan children on the same DMZ
   network will see the orphan parents as if synchronized to a server at
   the orphan stratum. Note that, as described on the
   :doc:`Orphan Mode
   <orphan>` page, all orphan children will
   select the same orphan parent for synchronization.
#. When a device driver has been configured for pulse-per-second (PPS)
   signals and PPS signals are being received, it is designated the *PPS
   driver.* Note that the Pulse-per-Second driver (type 22) is often
   used as a PPS driver, but any driver can be configure as a PPS driver
   if the hardware facilities are available. The PPS driver provides
   precision clock discipline only within Â±0.4 s, so it is always
   associated with another source or sources that provide the seconds
   numbering function.
#. When the Undisciplined Local Clock driver (type 1) is configured, it
   is designated the *local driver*. It can be used either as a backup
   source (stratum greater than zero) should all sources fail, or as the
   primary source (stratum zero) whether or not other sources are
   available if the ``prefer`` option is present. The local driver can
   be used when the kernel time is disciplined by some other means of
   synchronization, such as the NIST ``lock clock`` scheme, or another
   synchronization protocol such as the IEEE 1588 Precision Time
   Protocol (PTP) or Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS).
#. When the Automated Computer Time Service driver (type 18) is
   configured, it is designated the *modem driver*. It is used either as
   a backup source, should all other sources fail, or as the primary
   source if the ``prefer`` option is present.

.. _prefer-prefer:

The ``prefer`` Peer
-------------------------------------------------

The mitigation rules are designed to provide an intelligent selection of
the system peer from among the selectable sources of different types.
When used with the ``server`` or ``peer`` commands, the ``prefer``
option designates one or more sources as preferred over all others.
While the rules do not forbid it, it is usually not useful to designate
more than one source as preferred; however, if more than one source is
so designated, they are used in the order specified in the configuration
file. If the first one becomes un selectable, the second one is
considered and so forth. This order of priority is also applicable to
multiple PPS drivers, multiple modem drivers and even multiple local
drivers, although that would not normally be useful.

The cluster algorithm works on the set of truechimers produced by the
select algorithm. At each round the algorithm casts off the survivor
least likely to influence the choice of system peer. If selectable, the
prefer peer is never discarded; on the contrary, its potential removal
becomes a termination condition. However, the prefer peer can still be
discarded by the select algorithm as a falseticker; otherwise, the
prefer peer becomes the system peer.

Ordinarily, the combine algorithm computes a weighted average of the
survivor offset and jitter to produce the final values. However, if a
prefer peer is among the survivors, the combine algorithm is not used.
Instead, the offset and jitter of the prefer peer are used exclusively
as the final values. In the common case involving a radio clock and a
flock of remote backup servers, and with the radio clock designated a
prefer peer, the the radio clock disciplines the system clock as long as
the radio itself remains operational. However, if the radio fails or
becomes a falseticker, the combined backup sources continue to
discipline the system clock.

.. _prefer-miti:

Mitigation Rules
--------------------------------------------

As the select algorithm scans the associations for selectable
candidates, the modem driver and local driver are segregated for later,
but only if not designated a prefer peer. If so designated, the driver
is included among the candidate population. In addition, if orphan
parents are found, the parent with the lowest metric is segregated for
later; the others are discarded. For this purpose the metric is defined
as the four-octet IPv4 address or the first four octets of the hashed
IPv6 address. The resulting candidates, including any prefer peers
found, are processed by the select algorithm to produce a possibly empty
set of truechimers.

As previously noted, the cluster algorithm casts out outliers, leaving
the survivor list for later processing. The survivor list is then sorted
by increasing root distance and the first entry temporarily designated
the system peer. At this point the following contributors to the system
clock discipline may be available:

-  (potential) system peer, if there are survivors;
-  orphan parent, if present;
-  local driver, if present;
-  modem driver, if present;
-  prefer peer, if present;
-  PPS driver, if present.

The mitigation algorithm proceeds in three steps in turn.

#. If there are no survivors, the modem driver becomes the only survivor
   if there is one. If not, the local driver becomes the only survivor
   if there is one. If not, the orphan parent becomes the only survivor
   if there is one. If the number of survivors at this point is less
   than the ``minsane`` option of the :ref:`tos
   <miscopt-tos>` command, the algorithm is
   terminated and the system variables remain unchanged. Note that
   ``minsane`` is by default 1, but can be set at any value including 0.
#. If the prefer peer is among the survivors, it becomes the system peer
   and its offset and jitter are inherited by the corresponding system
   variables. Otherwise, the combine algorithm computes these variables
   from the survivor population.
#. If there is a PPS driver and the system clock offset at this point is
   less than 0.4 s, and if there is a prefer peer among the survivors or
   if the PPS peer is designated as a prefer peer, the PPS driver
   becomes the system peer and its offset and jitter are inherited by
   the system variables, thus overriding any variables already computed.
   Note that a PPS driver is present only if PPS signals are actually
   being received and enabled by the associated driver.

If none of the above is the case, the data are disregarded and the
system variables remain as they are.

.. _prefer-mins:

The ``minsane`` Option
--------------------------------------------------

The ``minsane`` option of the :ref:`tos
<miscopt-tos>` command, the ``prefer`` option
of the ``server`` and ``peer`` commands and the ``flag`` option of the
``fudge`` command for a selected driver can be used with the mitigation
rules to provide many useful configurations. The ``minsane`` option
specifies the minimum number of survivors required to synchronize the
system clock. The ``prefer`` option operates as described in previous
sections. The ``flag`` option enables the PPS signal for the selected
driver.

A common scenario is a GPS driver with a serial timecode and PPS signal.
The PPS signal is disabled until the system clock has been set by some
means, not necessarily the GPS driver. If the serial timecode is within
0.4 s of the PPS signal, the GPS driver is designated the PPS driver and
the PPS signal disciplines the system clock. If the serial timecode
becomes unreliable, or if the PPS signal is disconnected, the GPS driver
stops updating the system clock and so eventually becomes unreachable
and is replaced by other sources.

Whether or not the GPS driver disables the PPS signal when the timecode
becomes unreliable is at the discretion of the driver. Ordinarily, the
PPS signal is disabled in this case; however, when the GPS receiver has
a precision holdover oscillator, the driver may elect to continue PPS
discipline . In this case, ``minsane`` can be set to zero so the PPS
signal continues to discipline the system clock.
