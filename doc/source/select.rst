Clock Select Algorithm
======================

The clock select algorithm determines from a set of sources, which are
correct (*truechimers*) and which are not (*falsetickers*) according to
a set of formal correctness assertions. The principles are based on the
observation that the maximum error in determining the offset of a
candidate cannot exceed one-half the roundtrip delay to the primary
reference clock at the time of measurement. This must be increased by
the maximum error that can accumulate since then. The selection metric,
called the *root distance,*, is one-half the roundtrip root delay plus
the root dispersion plus minor error contributions not considered here.

First, a number of sanity checks is performed to sift the selectable
candidate from among the source population. The sanity checks are
sumarized as follows:

#. A *stratum error* occurs if (1) the source had never been
   synchronized or (2) the stratum of the source is below the ``floor``
   option or not below the ``ceiling`` option of the
   :ref:`tos <miscopt-tos>` command. The default values
   for these options are 0 and 15, respectively. Note that 15 is a valid
   stratum, but a server operating at that stratum cannot synchronize
   clients.
#. A *distance error* occurs for a source if the root distance (also
   known ad synchronization distance) of the source is not below the
   distance threshold ``maxdist`` option of the
   :ref:`tos <miscopt-tos>` command. The default value
   for this option is 1.5 s for networks including only the Earth, but
   this should be increased to 2.5 s for networks including the Moon.
#. A *loop* *error* occurs if the source is synchronized to the client.
   This can occur if two peers are configured with each other in
   symmetric modes.
#. An *unreachable* *error* occurs if the source is unreachable or if
   the ``server`` or ``peer`` command for the source includes the
   ``noselect`` option.

Sources showing one or more of these errors are considered
nonselectable; only the selectable candidates are considered in the
following algorithm. Given the measured offset θ\ :sub:`0` and root
distance λ, this defines a *correctness interval* [θ\ :sub:`0` − λ,
θ\ :sub:`0` + λ] of points where the true value of θ lies somewhere on
the interval. The given problem is to determine from a set of
correctness intervals, which represent truechimers and which represent
falsetickers. The principles must be given a precise definition. The
*intersection interval* is the *smallest interval containing points from
the largest number of correctness intervals.* An algorithm that finds
the intersection interval was devised by Keith Marzullo in his doctoral
dissertation. It was first implemented in the Digital Time
Synchronization Service (DTSS) for the VMS operating system for the VAX.

While the NTP algorithm is based on DTSS, it remains to establish which
point in the correctness interval represents the best estimate of the
offset for each candidate. The best point is at the midpoint θ\ :sub:`0`
of the correctness interval; however, the midpoint might not be within
the intersection interval. A candidate with a correctness interval that
contains points in the intersection interval is a truechimer and the
best offset estimate is the midpoint of its correctness interval. A
candidate with a correctness interval that contains no points in the
intersection interval is a falseticker.

  Intersection Interval

:numref:`correctness-fig` shows correctness intervals
for each of four candidates A, B, C and D.
We need to find the maximum number of candidates that contain
points in common. The result is the interval labeled DTSS. In the figure
there are three truechimers A, B and C, and one falseticker D. In DTSS
any point in the intersection interval can represent the true time;
however, as shown below, this may throw away valuable statistical
information. In any case, the clock is considered correct if the number
of truechimers found in this way are greater than half the total number
of candidates.

The question remains, which is the best point to represent the true time
of each correctness interval? Fortunately, we already have the maximum
likelihood estimate at the midpoint of each correctness interval. But,
while the midpoint of candidate C is outside the intersection interval,
its correctness interval contains points in common with the intersection
interval, so the candidate is a truechimer and the midpoint is chosen to
represent its time.

The DTSS correctness assertions do not consider how best to represent
the truechimer time. To support the midpoint choice, consider the
selection algorithm as a method to reject correctness intervals that
cannot contribute to the final outcome; that is, they are falsetickers.
The remaining correctness intervals can contribute to the final outcome;
that is, they are truechimers. Samples in the intersection interval are
usually of very low probability and thus poor estimates for truechimer
time. On the other hand, the midpoint sample produced by the clock
filter algorithm is the maximum likelihood estimate and thus best
represents the truechimer time.

  Clock Select Algorithm

The algorithm operates as shown in :numref:`clock-select-fig`.
Let *m* be the number of
candidates and *f* the number of falsetickers, initially zero. Move a
pointer from the leftmost endpoint towards the rightmost endpoint in
:numref:`correctness-fig` and count the number of candidates,
stopping when that number
reaches *m* − *f*; this is the left endpoint of the intersection
interval. Then, do the same, but moving from the rightmost endpoint
towards the leftmost endpoint; this is the right endpoint of the
intersection interval. If the left endpoint is less than the right
endpoint, the intersection interval has been found. Otherwise, increase
*f* by 1. If *f* is less than *n* / 2, try again; otherwise, the
algorithm fails and no truechimers could be found.

The clock select algorithm again scans the correctness intervals. If the
right endpoint of the correctness interval for a candidate is greater
than the left endpoint of the intersection interval, or if the left
endpoint of the correctness interval is less than the right endpoint of
the intersection interval, the candidate is a truechimer; otherwise, it
is a falseticker.

In practice, with fast LANs and modern computers, the correctness
interval can be quite small, especially when the candidates are multiple
reference clocks. In such cases the intersection interval might be
empty, due to insignificant differences in the reference clock offsets.
To avoid this, the size of the correctness interval is padded to the
value of ``mindist``, with default 1 ms. This value can be changed using
the ``mindist`` option of the :ref:`tos <miscopt-tos>` command.
