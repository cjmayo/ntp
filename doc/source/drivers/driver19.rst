Heath WWV/WWVH Receiver
=======================

Synopsis
--------

| Address: 127.127.19.\ *u*
|  Reference ID: ``WWV``
|  Driver ID: ``WWV_HEATH``
|  Serial Port: ``/dev/heathu``; 1200 baud, 8-bits, no parity
|  Features: ``tty_clk``
|  Requires: ``/usr/include/sys/termios.h`` header file with modem
  control

Description
-----------

This driver supports the Heath GC-1000 Most Accurate Clock, with RS232C
Output Accessory. This is a WWV/WWVH receiver somewhat less robust than
other supported receivers. It's claimed accuracy is 100 ms when actually
synchronized to the broadcast signal, but this doesn't happen even most
of the time, due to propagation conditions, ambient noise sources, etc.
When not synchronized, the accuracy is at the whim of the internal clock
oscillator, which can wander into the sunset without warning. Since the
indicated precision is 100 ms, expect a host synchronized only to this
thing to wander to and fro, occasionally being rudely stepped when the
offset exceeds the default CLOCK\_MAX of 128 ms.

The internal DIPswitches should be set to operate at 1200 baud in MANUAL
mode and the current year. The external DIPswitches should be set to GMT
and 24-hour format. It is very important that the year be set correctly
in the DIPswitches; otherwise, the day of year will be incorrect after
28 April of a normal or leap year.

In MANUAL mode the clock responds to a rising edge of the request to
send (RTS) modem control line by sending the timecode. Therefore, it is
necessary that the operating system implement the ``TIOCMBIC`` and
``TIOCMBIS`` ioctl system calls and ``TIOCM_RTS`` control bit. Present
restrictions require the use of a POSIX-compatible programming
interface, although other interfaces may work as well.

The clock message consists of 23 ASCII printing characters in the
following format:

::

    hh:mm:ss.f     dd/mm/yr<cr>

    hh:mm:ss.f = hours, minutes, seconds
    f = deciseconds ('?' when out of spec)
    dd/mm/yr = day, month, year

The alarm condition is indicated by '?', rather than a digit, at A. Note
that 0?:??:??.? is displayed before synchronization is first established
and hh:mm:ss.? once synchronization is established and then lost again
for about a day.

A fudge time1 value of .07 s appears to center the clock offset
residuals.

Fudge Factors
-------------

``time1 time``
    Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and
    fraction, with default 0.0.
``time2 time``
    Not used by this driver.
``stratum number``
    Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default
    0.
``refid string``
    Specifies the driver reference identifier, an ASCII string from one
    to four characters, with default ``WWV``.
``flag1 0 | 1``
    Not used by this driver.
``flag2 0 | 1``
    Not used by this driver.
``flag3 0 | 1``
    Not used by this driver.
``flag4 0 | 1``
    Not used by this driver
