Reference Clock Support
=======================

NTP Version 4 supports almost four dozen satellite, radio and telephone
modem reference clocks plus several audio devices for instrumentation
signals. A general description of the reference clock support is on this
page. Additional information about each reference clock driver can be
found via links from this page. Additional information is on the
:doc:`Debugging Hints for Reference Clock
Drivers <rdebug>` and
:doc:`How To Write a Reference Clock Driver
<howto>` pages. Information on how to support
pulse-per-second (PPS) signals produced by some devices is on the
:doc:`Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal Interfacing
<pps>` page. All reference clock drivers
require that the reference clock use only Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC). Timezone and standard/daylight adjustments are performed by the
operating system kernel.

A reference clock will generally (though not always) be a radio timecode
receiver synchronized to standard time as provided by NIST and USNO in
the US, NRC in Canada and their counterparts elsewhere in the world. A
device driver specific to each reference clock must be compiled in the
distribution; however, most common radio, satellite and telephone modem
clocks are included by default and are activated by configuration
commands.

Reference clocks are supported in the same way as ordinary NTP clients
and use the same filter, select, cluster and combine algorithms. Drivers
have addresses in the form 127.127.\ *t.u*, where *t* is the driver type
and *u* is a unit number in the range 0-3 to distinguish multiple
instances of the same driver. The connection to the computer is device
dependent, usually a serial port, parallel port or special bus
peripheral, but some can work directly from an audio codec or sound
card. The particular device is specified by adding a soft link from the
name used by the driver to the particular device name.

The ``server`` command is used to configure a reference clock. Only the
``mode``, ``minpoll``, ``maxpoll``, and ``prefer`` options are supported
for reference clocks, as described on the
:doc:`Reference Clock Commands
<clockopt>` page. The ``prefer`` option is
discussed on the :doc:`Mitigation Rules and the
prefer Keyword <prefer>` page. Some of these
options have meaning only for selected clock drivers.

The ``fudge`` command can be used to provide additional information for
individual drivers and normally follows immediately after the ``server``
command. The reference clock stratum is by default 0, so that the server
stratum appears to clients as 1. The ``stratum`` option can be used to
set the stratum to any value in the range 0 through 15. The ``refid``
option can be used to change the reference identifier, as might in the
case when the driver is disciplined by a pulse-per-second (PPS) source.
The device-dependent ``mode``, ``time`` and ``flag`` options can provide
additional driver customization.

Special Considerations
--------------------------------------------------

The :doc:`Audio Drivers
<audio>` page describes three software drivers
that process audio signals from an audio codec or sound card. One is for
the NIST time and frequency stations WWV and WWVH, another for the
Canadian time and frequency station CHU. These require an external
shortwave radio and antenna. A third is for the generic IRIG signal
produced by some timing devices. Currently, these are supported in
FreeBSD, Solaris and SunOS and likely in other system as well.

The :doc:`Undisciplined Local Clock
<drivers/driver1>` driver can simulate a
reference clock when no external synchronization sources are available.
If a server with this driver is connected directly or indirectly to the
public Internet, there is some danger that it can destabilize other
clients. It is not recommended that the local clock driver be used in
this way, as the orphan mode described on the
:doc:`Association Management
<assoc>` page provides a generic backup
capability.

The local clock driver can also be used when an external synchronization
source such as the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol or NIST Lockclock
directly synchronizes the computer time. Further information is on the
:doc:`External Clock Discipline and the Local
Clock Driver <extern>` page.

Several drivers make use of the pulse-per-second (PPS)Â signal
discipline, which is part of the generic driver interface, so require no
specific configuration. For those drivers that do not use this
interface, the :doc:`PPS Clock Discipline
<drivers/driver22>` driver can be can provide
this function. It normally works in conjunction with the reference clock
that produces the timecode signal, but can work with another driver or
remote server. When PPS kernel features are present, the driver can
redirect the PPS signal to the kernel.

Some drivers depending on longwave or shortwave radio services need to
know the radio propagation time from the transmitter to the receiver.
This must be calculated for each specific receiver location and requires
the geographic coordinates of both the transmitter and receiver. The
transmitter coordinates for various radio services are given in the
`Time and Frequency Standard Station
Information <http://www.eecis.udel.edu/%7emills/ntp/qth.html>`__ page.
Receiver coordinates can be obtained locally or from Google Earth. The
actual calculations are beyond the scope of this document.

Depending on interface type, port speed, etc., a reference clock can
have a small residual offset relative to another. To reduce the effects
of jitter when switching from one driver to the another, it is useful to
calibrate the drivers to a common ensemble offset. The
``enable calibrate`` configuration command described on the
:doc:`Miscellaneous Options
<miscopt>` page activates a special feature
which automatically calculates a correction factor for each driver
relative to an association designated the prefer peer.
