Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) Signal Interfacing
=========================================

Most radio clocks are connected using a serial port operating at speeds
of 9600 bps. The accuracy using typical timecode formats, where the
on-time epoch is indicated by a designated ASCII character such as
carriage-return ``<cr>``, is normally limited to 100 μs. Using carefully
crafted averaging techniques, the NTP algorithms can whittle this down
to a few tens of microseconds. However, some radios produce a
pulse-per-second (PPS) signal which can be used to improve the accuracy
to a few microseconds. This page describes the hardware and software
necessary for NTP to use the PPS signal.

The PPS signal can be connected in either of two ways. On FreeBSD
systems (with the PPS\_SYNC and pps kernel options) it can be connected
directly to the ACK pin of a parallel port. This is the preferred way,
as it requires no additional hardware. Alternatively, it can be
connected via the DCD pin of a serial port. However, the PPS signal
levels are usually incompatible with the serial port interface signals.
Note that NTP no longer supports connection via the RD pin of a serial
port.

Gadget Box
----------------------------------------

The gadget box shown above is assembled in a 5"x3"x2" aluminum minibox
containing the the circuitry, serial connector and optional 12-V power
connector. A complete set of schematics, PCB artwork, drill templates
can be obtained via the web from ftp.udel.edu as
`gadget.tar.Z <ftp://ftp.udel.edu/pub/ntp/hardware/gadget.tar.Z>`__.

The gadget box includes two subcircuits. One of these converts a TTL
positive edge into a fixed-width pulse at EIA levels and is for use with
a timecode receiver or precision oscillator with a TTL PPS output. The
other converts the timecode modulation broadcast by Canadian
time/frequency standard station CHU into a 300-bps serial character
stream at EIA levels and is for use with the
:doc:`Radio CHU Audio Demodulator/Decoder
<drivers/driver7>` driver.

Operating System Support
-----------------------------------------------------

Both the serial and parallel port connection require operating system
support, which is available in a few operating systems, including
FreeBSD, Linux (with PPSkit patch) and Solaris. Support on an
experimental basis is available for several other systems, including
SunOS and HP/Compaq/Digital Tru64. The kernel interface described on the
:doc:`PPSAPI Interface for Precision Time
Signals <kernpps>` page is the only interface
currently supported. Older PPS interfaces based on the ``ppsclock`` and
``tty_clk`` streams modules are no longer supported. The interface
consists of the ``timepps.h`` header file which is specific to each
system. It is included automatically when the distribution is built.

PPS Driver
----------

PPS support requires is built into some drivers, in particular the WWVB
and NMEA drivers, and may be added to other drivers in future.
Alternatively, the PPS driver described on the
:doc:`Type 22 PPS Clock Discipline
<drivers/driver22>` page can be used. It
operates in conjunction with another source that provides seconds
numbering. The selected source is designate a prefer peer, as using the
``prefer`` option, as described on the
:doc:`Mitigation Rules and the prefer Keyword
<prefer>` page. The prefer peer is ordinarily
the radio clock that provides the PPS signal, but in principle another
radio clock or even a remote Internet server could be designated
preferred Note that the ``pps`` configuration command has been obsoleted
by this driver.

Using the Pulse-per-Second (PPS) Signal
------------------------------------------------------------------

The PPS signal can be used in either of two ways, one using the NTP
grooming and mitigation algorithms and the other using the kernel PPS
signal support described in the :doc:`Kernel
Model for Precision Timekeeping <kern>` page.
The presence of  kernel support is automatically detected during the NTP
build process and supporting code automatically compiled. In either
case, the PPS signal must be present and within nominal jitter and
wander tolerances. In addition, the prefer peer must be a truechimer;
that is, survive the sanity checks and intersection algorithm. Finally,
the offset of the system clock relative to the prefer peer must be
within ±0.5 s. The kernel maintains a watchdog timer for the PPS signal;
if the signal has not been heard or is out of tolerance for more than
some interval, currently two minutes, the kernel discipline is disabled
and operation continues as if it were not present.

An option flag in the driver determines whether the NTP algorithms or
kernel support is enabled (if available). For historical reasons, the
NTP algorithms are selected by by default, since performance is
generally better using older, slower systems. However, performance is
generally better with kernl support using newer, faster systems.
